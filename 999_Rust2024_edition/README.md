# 올해 하반기에 나올 Rust 2024에 대해
- Rust 2024 style edition

- This style guide describes the Rust 2024 style edition. The Rust 2024 style edition is currently nightly-only and may change before the release of Rust 2024.

- For a full history of changes in the Rust 2024 style edition, see the git history of the style guide. Notable changes in the Rust 2024 style edition include:

- 114764 As the last member of a delimited expression, delimited expressions are generally combinable, regardless of the number of members. Previously only applied with exactly one member (except for closures with explicit blocks).
Miscellaneous rustfmt bugfixes.
Use version-sort (sort x8, x16, x32, x64, x128 in that order).
Change "ASCIIbetical" sort to Unicode-aware "non-lowercase before lowercase".
